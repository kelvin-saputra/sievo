## Description

**SIEVO** is an integrated event management information system designed specifically for PT Matahati Insphira. The main goal of this system is to enhance the company's operational efficiency by optimizing event planning processes, team coordination, event reporting, and the digitization of real-time event progress.

This system addresses various challenges previously faced by PT Matahati Insphira, such as:
* **Difficulties in manual team coordination** (via WhatsApp and Excel) prone to miscommunication.
* **Lack of a real-time event progress monitoring system**.
* **Unstructured and scattered documentation**, leading to risks of data loss or inconsistency.
* **Slow and manual event report generation processes**.
* **Inefficient budget management**.
* **Absence of an integrated vendor and client database**.

**SIEVO** is designed for use by various roles within the company, including Executives, Internal Employees, and Freelancers.
